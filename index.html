                    <p>My name is Dawson Hamilton and I am 20 years old. I live in Murray
                        Utah. I used to live with my parents in West Valley with my parents until I moved out.
                        I'm currently attending the University of Utah coding boot
                        camp trying to learn how to become a computer programmer.
                        I attended the American Internation School of Utah and graduated in 2017.
                        After highschool I decided to try and get my firefighter certifications and
                        passed that with flying colors but decided that I didn't want to be an EMT.
                        After that I looked into other things that I was into like music development, soccer, video
                        games... I decided to go with computer programming because I took a class in
                        highschool and really enjoyed it.

                    <p>
                        I currently work at Cracker Barrel as a full time server and hope to
                        leave there as soon as possible. In my free time I love anything about computers whether thats
                        me building them by hand, web designing, or even playing video games.Some of the games I like
                        are
                        Rainbow Six Siege, Destiny 2, Overwatch... I also love to watch videos
                        on Youtube, hang out with my freinds from high school, and play lots and lots of DnD.
                        I would really love to become a video game designer when I'm done with this class to
                        design a game of my own. A couple fun facts about me is that I am certified to be a
                        fire fighter but don't enjoy being a EMT so that is why I am here. Also, I have a
                        daughter that was just born Oct. 21st of 2019 and couldn't be happier!
